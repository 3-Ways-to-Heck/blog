# Internet privacy is not as simple as it seems #

What would you do if a single company had access to all of your personal information and could narrate your life’s story back to you?

## **The Problem** ##

That is the dilemma faced by millions across the globe with the rise of corporations like Apple, Facebook, and Google. 

Because of our ever-increasing dependence on the internet, our exposure to companies that dominate the World-Wide-Web is also growing. With the sudden abrupt change to our lifestyle that came to be with the pandemic, our usage of the internet has rocketed. Companies such as Zoom experienced as much as 30x more usage within the months following the start of the lockdown. Online technologies used to communicate underwent extensive growth and popularity, namely Discord, Microsoft Teams, and some other competitors. 

A prime example of the info that tech giants have been able to collect on their users over the years is the Cambridge Analytica scandal. 87 million users and a lot of bad publicity can certainly cause a lot of doubt about the company. Facebook is not the only company to collect data at such a large capacity; as the tech giants have grown exponentially in the last decade, the amount of data they collect has as well. Not only do they collect data from the apps they own, but they also buy data from other companies like Spotify, Uber, and other consumer focused apps. This leads to a mass data collection that ends up in the hands of a single body which can be considered not the best of situations.

## **The Data** ##

Big Data companies are known for collecting data of all types on all types of users.
For example some types of data that Google collects:
* Places you’ve searched in Google maps
* Apps that you’ve used (if you own an Android device)
* Everything you’ve asked your Google device (if you own a Google device)
* Every video you’ve watched on YouTube
* Every comment you have left on YouTube
* All Gmail files, downloads, emails and even drafts

It is also possible to get your data back; Apple sends a bunch of excel sheets (csv’s) with your data. It is interesting to note that these excel spreadsheets did not contain any content information like text messages or photos, yet contained a lot of header information such as who you texted or called.

[editor's note: I've edited a bit of the grammar issues but once all the content is established and I've added my share we should definitely revise the last paragraph because it breaks flow and the sentences are chopped up pretty weirdly]::
