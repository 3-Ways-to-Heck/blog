## Think

When we visit the website, we are greeted with a message: `Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!`. Seeing the word "browser" in the context of a restricted website makes me immediately think of User-Agents. When we visit a website, the client sends some information to the server, including our browser, operating system, and device information. So, let's:
1. right click on the page and select `Inspect` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I` in Chrome to open Chrome DevTools
2. click on the 3 vertical dots (&#8942;) on the top bar >> More tools >> Network conditions

A new `Network conditions` tab will pop up on the bottom pane.
1. Uncheck the `Select automatically` box
2. Select `Custom...` from the dropdown menu
3. Type `PicoBrowser` into the User agent box

## Solve



And...we got the flag! `picoCTF{pwn_4ll_th3_cook1E5_5f016958}`
