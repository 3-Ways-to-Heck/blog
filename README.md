# website

Put all your blog work here for now. If you have any ideas, just dump them in the blog chat. Things to do and research is on the Project section.

### to-do list

* figure out what everyone wants to [research](https://samsclass.info/197/research.htm) (figure out a table of contents/subtopics for your article, try to tell it like a story )
* actually make the website (grabbing a host, domain, figuring out our framework/layout)
* migrate current ctfwriteup content over
* compile all the research into several topics/papers
* last to do but get the pathways of training.baycyber.net and possibly develop our own version?

dm me on disc if you have any questions or need some direction
