Put all your blog work here for now. If you have any ideas, just dump them in the blog chat. Things to do and research is on the Project section.

### to-do list

* figure out what everyone wants to [research](https://samsclass.info/197/research.htm) (figure out a table of contents/subtopics for your article, try to tell it like a story )
* actually make the website (grabbing a host, domain, figuring out our framework/layout)
* migrate current ctfwriteup content over
* compile all the research into several topics/papers

dm me on disc if you have any questions or need some direction
